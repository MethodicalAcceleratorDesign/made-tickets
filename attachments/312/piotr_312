Hi,

After discussion with Piotr and some testing it turns out that:

a) Obviously EMIT does the absolute correct thing! It goes to 2D when
either VOLT=0 or the lag is wrong. This is the case here: the lag
should be 0.5 but is 0. Therefore EMIT goes 2D which ptc_twiss must do
as well, of course!

B) The former version (4860 and earlier) did recognize either that
the voltage is zero or that the lag was not set properly, i.e. the cavity
is not active in MAD_X. Therefore PTC_TWISS downgraded the user
specified "icase=6" to "icase=56" and all worked fine.

b) as of  version 4920 it does not check the lag anymore and considers
wrongly that the motion in 3D would be stable causing a DA failure.

Cheers, FS
